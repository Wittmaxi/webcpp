[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/72390726fa43493aa05070081c40c3e9)](https://app.codacy.com/app/Wittmaxi/webcpp?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Wittmaxi/webcpp&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

A simple framework to organize C++ CGI applications

## Installation 
In order to Install the library, run

```console
user@name: git clone https://github.com/Wittmaxi/webcpp
user@name: cd webcpp
user@name: make install 
```

Include <webcpp/webcpp.hpp>.

!! IMPORTANT : compile with -lwcp

## Compatibility and Future
This library was developed on and for \*nix systems. A port to windows should be easy to do.
This library will keep backwards compatibility. Components which names are changed will have a typedef to the old name.

## Purpose
WebCPP is a template engine to simplify the task of creating C++ Web-Applications. <br>
It consists of 
1) A template engine that generates HTML code <br>
2) A set of tools that simplify the interaction with the user <br>

## Usage
In order to understand this quick walkthrough, you should read [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_web_programming.htm) first!

### Output Stream
The entire set of tools outputs it's response to the global variable WCP::wcpout. Wcpout has the following functions to retrieve the content. If none of them is called, the destructor will automatically output the entire content to the standard-output. 
```c++
void outputToFile(const std::string &fileName);
void outputToSTDOUT();
std::string getString();
```
Every output should be done through wcpout!

### HTTP Header
In order to tell the webserver what to do with your code output, you need an HTTP-Header. 
This header is constituted by the class `WCP::HTTPHeader` Instantiate it and call it's print function before doing any other output!
The HTTP Header also provides methods for setting cookies and other HTTP-Functionalities
```void HTTPHeader::addCookie(const std::string &name, const std::string &value, const bool HTTPonly, const std::string &expiry)```
This will set a cookie in the client's browser. 
```void HTTPHeader::addFlag(const std::string &flag)```
This function will add an unfiltered Line to the HTTP request. To use with care!

Once you are done providing the HTTPHeader with this information, call 
```wcpout << yourHTTPHeader;```
to print it out!

### Functionality
The template engine works by having blocks that accept an infinite amount of other Blocks as constructor elements. <br>

For example, like this:

```c++
BlockType1 {
  BlockType2{ 
  },
  BlockType2 {
    BlockType2 {
    
    }, 
    BlockType3 {
    
    }
  }
}
```
-The entire Library is wrapped inside of the namespace ```WCP::```.
-All Blocks inherit from WCP::Block

---
Any Block implemented by the Library can be outputted by means of std::cout. 
Example: 
```c++
std::cout << Document {

};
```
---
The entire Page should be wrapped inside of the ```Document``` block, which generates the ```<html> ... </html>``` part of the website. 

### Blocks commonly found in HTML-Headers

The ```<head> </head>``` is generated by the Block called ```Head```. It accepts as constructor arguments an infinite amount of Blocks that inherit from ```WCP::HeaderObject``` 

---

```WCP::Title``` 
Accepts a ```WCP::Text``` as argument. Creates the Website-Title

---

```WCP::Include```
Accepts three ```std::string```s as argument. The first argument is the hyperreference, the second is the type of the included file and the third is the relationship to the current document. 

---

```WCP::IncludeScript```
Accepts a ```std::string``` as argument, which is a hyperreference to a script document. 

---

```WCP::HttpEquiv```
Accepts two ```std::string```s as arguments. The first is the equiv argument of ```<meta http-equiv="">```, the second is the value.

---

```WCP::Charset```
Accepts a ```std::string``` with the name of the charset of the page. The use of "utf-8" is recommended.

---

```WCP::Meta```
Accepts two ```std::string```s, the first one being for the name attribute of the ```<meta>``` tag, the second for the content attribute.

### Blocks commonly found in HTML-Bodies

The entire ```<body> </body>``` Section is generated by ```WCP::Body```.

---

```WCP::H1``` -> ```WCP::H6```
Generate the ```<h1> </h1>``` to ```<h6> </h6>``` tags respectively.

---

```WCP::LineBreak```
Generates a linebreak. One object of it is created, called Break.

---

```WCP::Centered```
Centers the content. 

---

```WCP::Table```
Creates a table

---

```WCP::Row```
Creates a row in a table

---

```WCP::Cell```
Creates a Cell in a Table-Row

---

```WCP::HighlightedCell```
Creates a highlighted Cell in a Table-Row

---

```WCP::Container```
Creates a Container.

---

```WCP::NavBar```
Creates a navbar.

---

``` WCP::HyperLink```
Creates an Hyperlink.

---

```WCP::Marked```
Creates a Marked section

--- 

```WCP::Form```
Creates a Form

---

```WCP::Input```
creates an input element inside of a form.

---

```WCP::Paragraph```
Creates a paragraph

--- 

```WCP::Image```
Includes an Image

---

```WCP::Picture```

Optional Wrapper around Images

---

```WCP::Source```
To be used inside of ```WCP::Picture```. States a source for a picture.

---

```WCP::HorizontalLine```
Creates a Horizontal line. Can't take any arguments. 

---

```WCP::Quote```
Creates a blockquote

---

```WCP::Label```
Creates a Label

---
```WCP::Text``` 
Prints out Text that escapes dangerous characters.

---
```WCP::UnformattedText```
Prints out an unprocessed Text.

---
```WCP::ConvenientText```
Prints out a Text that escapes dangerous characters, changes line breaks "\n" to the html-tag "< br >" and replace tabulators "\t" with a box that is 40 pixels wide.

---

```WCP::Function```
Expects a std::function <void(void)> as argument. It doesn't print anything, but runs the given function in between the opening parent and closing parent tag. 

### Attributes
HTML - Tags can have attributes. Any Block, that can take an infinite amount of Blocks can also take an Infinite amount of Attributes. Attributes accept a string that will be added to the HTML tag in the following way: ```<html_tag + "specified argument's string">```. WCP::Attribute just adds a string, while the other attributes add a certain attribute specifier. Class attribute, for example, changes the tag to ```<html class="specified string">```

---

```WCP::Attribute``` 
An attribute that can be anything. 

---

```WCP::ClassAttribute```
Assigns one or multiple Css-Classes to the Block.

---

```WCP::IdAttribute```
Assigns one or multiple CSS-IDs to the Block.

---

```WCP::StyleAttribute```
Directly assigns Css-Style to the block

---

```WCP::SourceAttribute```
Assigns a content-source to a Block

---
```WCP::HyperReference```
Assigns a href attribute to a Block.

---

```WCP::FormMethod```
Sets the Method of data processing of a Form. Possible values "GET" or "POST"

---

```WCP::InputType```
Sets the type of an Input Block

---

```WCP::InputValue```
Sets the standard value of an Input Block.

### Environment Variables
All the Environment Variables are handled by the Namespace WCP::ENV.
To initialize the handler, use 
```WCP::ENV::initializeENV()```.
Then, you can get both the arguments passed as POST and GET request with both

```WCP::ENV::GET (std::string name)``` and ```WCP::ENV::POST(std::string name)``` 
Both functions return a UTF8-String that has already escaped the browser escape signals. 

```WCP::ENV::COOKIE (std::string name)``` 
Returns the value of the cookie with name "name".

## HTTP Header
An HTTP Header provides the browser with information about the webpage. 
Webcpp has a class that generates HTTP Headers. That class is called ```WCP::HTTPHeader```

```WCP::HTTPHeader::setContentType(std::string type);```
adds an HTTP Header flag setting the content type

```WCP::HTTPHeader::addCookie(std::string name, std::string value, bool HTTPonly, std::string expiry)```
Sets a cookie.

```WCP::HTTPHeader::addFlag (std::string flag)```
Just outputs a plain HTTP flag.

```WCP::HTTPHeader::print()```
Prints the HTTP header. Has to be called before any other content has been generated.
